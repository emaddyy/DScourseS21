\section{Part 1}

I think that it would be interesting to scrape data from Reddit. With so many forums and topics, it would be interesting to see how posts and engagement relate to measurable, quantifiable outcomes. For example, scraping popular trading forums (r/wallstreetbets, r/pennystocks, etc.) could lead to a predicative model for personal investments. Additionally, it would be interesting to conduct sentiment analysis on r/news and compare it with other news platforms (WSJ, NYT, etc.)
