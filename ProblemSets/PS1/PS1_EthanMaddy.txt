\section{Introduction}
To say I have a lot of interests would be a gross understatement. 
I have loved economics since high school, and that love hasn't diminished. 
Having learned what I have through economics, I know that I will always be involved with the field. 
I am interested in data science because of the uses it can have for finding solutions to complex problems. 
I wanted to take this class because of how much I enjoyed econometrics. 
I have not done any data analysis on food insecurity, so I hope to have my final project center around that. 
I hope to gain a deeper understanding of data analysis and processes through this class. 
After I graduate from OU, I plan on going to law school to become a public health lawyer.
